a game on Ethereum, where every player can purchase unique zombies, can battle with other user’s zombies.

You can build your zombie army and multiply that army by feeding on other lifeforms such as cryptokitties (using the interface for cryprokitties contract).

Each zombie has a level which can be increased by feeding on other zombies and also by competing in battles.
